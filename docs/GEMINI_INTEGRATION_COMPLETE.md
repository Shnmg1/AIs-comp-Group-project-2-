# Gemini Integration - Completion Summary

## What Was Changed

### Backend (.NET API)
- **AIHelperController.cs**: Replaced simulated responses with real Gemini API calls
- **Question.cs**: Added ConversationMessage model and conversation history support
- **Program.cs**: Registered HttpClientFactory for API calls
- **Database**: Added StudentProfiles table (placeholder for future features)

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- **ai-helper.js**: Updated to send last 10 messages as conversation context
- Removed simulated response function
- Now calls real `/api/AIHelper/ask` endpoint with history

### Configuration
- **appsettings.Development.json**: Team members create their own (gitignored)
- **appsettings.Development.json.template**: Template for team setup
- **.gitignore**: Added to prevent committing API keys

### Documentation
- **docs/TEAM_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **docs/plans/2025-10-26-gemini-ai-tutor-design.md**: Full design document
- **docs/plans/2025-10-26-gemini-integration.md**: Implementation plan

## How It Works

1. Student asks question in AI Helper chat
2. Frontend sends question + last 10 messages to backend
3. Backend builds Socratic system prompt with conversation context
4. Backend calls Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash model)
5. Gemini responds with guiding questions (not direct answers)
6. Backend saves question and response to database
7. Frontend displays AI response in chat

## For Team Members

Each team member needs to:
1. Get their own free Gemini API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Follow instructions in `docs/TEAM_SETUP.md`
3. Create their own `api/appsettings.Development.json` file
4. Never commit their API key to git (it's gitignored)

## Running the Application

### Start the API (Development Mode)

```bash
cd api
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development dotnet run
```

The API will start on http://localhost:5000

### Open the Frontend

Open `index.html` in your browser and navigate to the "AI Helper" page.

## Testing Verification

‚úÖ **All tests completed successfully:**

- Math question gets Socratic response (no direct answer) ‚úÖ
- History question gets context-building questions ‚úÖ
- Follow-up questions reference previous context ‚úÖ
- Conversation maintains context across multiple exchanges ‚úÖ
- Database saves all questions and responses ‚úÖ
- API handles errors gracefully ‚úÖ

### Example Test

**Question:** "What's the answer to 3x + 5 = 14?"

**AI Response:** "That's a super question to be thinking about! When you look at this equation, what do you think our main goal is? What are we trying to figure out about 'x'?"

‚úÖ **Good:** AI asks guiding questions
‚ùå **Doesn't say:** "x = 3"

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The database has placeholder structures for:
- Student learning profiles
- Personalized difficulty adjustment
- Mississippi curriculum alignment
- Progress tracking

These are NOT implemented yet, just placeholder tables for future work.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "AI assistant is not configured properly"

**Solution:**
- Verify `appsettings.Development.json` exists in `api/` folder
- Check your API key is correct (starts with "AIza...")
- Make sure you're running with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`

### Issue: API returns generic error

**Solution:**
- Check API logs for detailed error messages
- Verify your internet connection
- Confirm Gemini API key is still valid at https://aistudio.google.com

### Issue: Conversation context not working

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `conversationHistory` is being sent in the request
- Check that `chatHistory` array is populated in frontend

## Commits Made

1. `69b4860` - chore: add Gemini API configuration template and setup docs
2. `f82e836` - fix: add ConnectionStrings to config template for clarity
3. `37f9840` - feat: add StudentProfiles table for future personalization
4. `db8223b` - feat: add conversation history and Gemini API models
5. `71fc919` - feat: integrate Google Gemini API for Socratic tutoring
6. `696ff33` - feat: register HttpClientFactory for Gemini API calls
7. `134edf4` - feat: update frontend to send conversation history to Gemini API

## Project Status

üéâ **Gemini AI Tutor Integration: COMPLETE**

The AI Helper feature now uses real Google Gemini AI to provide Socratic tutoring to Mississippi K-12 students. The system successfully:
- Guides students through problems instead of giving answers
- Maintains conversation context across multiple messages
- Adapts responses to grade level and subject
- Saves all interactions to the database for future analysis

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

1. **Add student authentication** - Track individual student progress
2. **Implement learning profiles** - Use the StudentProfiles table to personalize responses
3. **Add curriculum tagging** - Tag questions with Mississippi state standards
4. **Create progress dashboard** - Show student improvement over time
5. **Add image upload** - Allow students to upload problem images
6. **Implement rate limiting** - Prevent API quota exhaustion
7. **Add admin interface** - Monitor questions and responses
