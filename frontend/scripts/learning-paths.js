If the tens are the same, then look at the ones place. For example, to compare 47 and 52, we see that 5 tens is more than 4 tens, so 52 > 47.

For subtraction like 82 - 37, you can count up from 37 to 82, or subtract the tens and ones separately. You can also use mental math by adjusting numbers to make them easier - for example, 49 + 23 can be thought of as 50 + 22. Understanding place value helps you choose the best strategy!

One strategy is to make friendly numbers - numbers that are easy to work with like 10, 20, 50, or 100.

Another strategy is compensation - moving amounts between numbers to make calculation easier. You can also break numbers into parts: 45 + 32 can be thought of as (40 + 30) + (5 + 2) = 70 + 7 = 77. Practicing mental math makes you faster and improves your number sense!</p>',

The theme is the big idea or message of a story - what the author wants you to learn or think about. Common themes include friendship, courage, honesty, and perseverance. The moral is the lesson the story teaches, often found in fables. For example, in "The Tortoise and the Hare," the moral is "Slow and steady wins the race," which teaches us not to give up even when things are hard. To find the theme, think about what the characters learned and what the story is really about beyond just the plot. Ask yourself: "What lesson did the characters learn?" and "What is the author trying to teach me?" Understanding themes helps you connect stories to your own life!</p>',

Think about characters\' personalities - are they brave or fearful? Kind or mean? Patient or impatient? Also consider their actions - what they do shows who they are.

An advertisement tries to persuade you to buy something. A science book informs you about animals or space. A funny story entertains you. Sometimes authors have more than one purpose - a story can entertain AND teach a lesson. To identify the author\'s purpose, think about what the text does: Does it try to change your mind?

Future tense verbs tell about actions that will happen, using "will": "will walk," "will play," "will jump." Some verbs are irregular and don\'t follow the -ed pattern: "run" becomes "ran," not "runned." Every sentence needs a subject (who or what) and a predicate (what they do).

For example, if you drive $120$ miles in $2$ hours, the rate is $\frac{120 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}}$. The unit rate is found by dividing: $120 \div 2 = 60$. So, the unit rate is $60$ miles per $1$ hour (or $60$ mph). **Unit price** is a special type of unit rate that tells you the cost per one unit (like cost per ounce or per item). Finding the unit rate helps you compare different values and solve real-world problems, such as finding the best deal at the grocery store.</p>',
